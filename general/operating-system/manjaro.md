# Manjaro

Often, I'll install Manjaro to simplify the multi-boot setting process.

1. `manjaro-chroot -a` if you have a Boot LiveCD
2. `update-grub`
3. `grub-install /dev/**`

> The boot menu of Manjaro will auto-remember the last selection of OS. So you don't have to choose which OS to boot next time when you boot your machine.
