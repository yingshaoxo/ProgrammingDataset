# Virtual Ubuntu

For some reason, you may not be able to let the ubuntu system be the host system (I mean the system that directly handles the hardware.

In this case, you could use virtual container technology, for example, docker.

After you set up the virtual ubuntu server, you may want to set the openssh-server immediately, so that you could connect to it by using ssh-command or vs-code-remote-plugin to do some development.

Here is an example of it:
