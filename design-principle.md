1. Use database to save users data is better than using JSON file (JSON was meant to be used in server-client communication)

2. Make things done, don't let mess continuous. Also, never let a project(repository) unfinished.

3. If you could design a package with binary, don't do it with codes (unless it can compile to binary, like c, c++, golang, cython). You will gradually know that only binary file could be used at every platform or machine without much worry.
